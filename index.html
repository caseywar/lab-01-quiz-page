                My name is Casey Warren. I am a fun, outgoing person who always loves a new adventure. I am multifacited
                in that I can be as hype as a 21 year old college kid or as chill as a 87 year old woman. I like to
                exist in both states equally. In the following paragraphs I will list facts about myself that you better
                remember, there will be a quiz.

                I am 27 years old and live in Kalamazoo, MI. I am originally from a small town
                called Middleville, but I have lived in Kalamazoo for the last 10 years. Kalamazoo has a thriving music
                and art scene. Pre-covid, there would be concerts downtown or house shows every weekend.
                Most people in our community strive to create a safe space for everyone. It is a truly wonderful
                and fun place!
                <p></p>

                One of my favorite pass times is going camping. There is an amazing spot about 2 hours from where I
                live, we call it 'The Spot'. The Spot is amazing because it is all rustic camping, you can choose to
                camp by your car or hike in and park on the cliff or in the sand dunes. You can also have fires right on
                the shore of Lake Michigan. It is not monitored by DNR heavily so theres baiscally no rules, its great!
                this summer I went on:
                <ul>
                    <li>June 27, 2020</li>
                    <li>July 20, 2020</li>
                    <li>August 7, 2020</li>
                    <li>August 23, 2020</li>
                    <li>Septemmber 13, 2020</li>
                </ul>
                It was a succesful summer of camping!

                <p></p>
                Another favoirte activity I used to enjoy was going to music festivals. I went to my first festival in
                2014 and really enjoyed how you could choose your own adventure and go see any bands you wanted. My
                favoirte festivals I've gone to are:
                <ol>
                    <li>Camp Greensky</li>
                    <li>Hoxeyville Music Festival</li>
                    <li>Electric Forest</li>
                    <li>Detroit Electronic Music Festival</li>
                    <li>The Werk Out</li>
                    <li>Summer Camp</li>
                </ol>
